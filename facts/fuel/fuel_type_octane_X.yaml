notes: |
  - Pattern: fuel_type_octane_{octane_rating} where octane_rating is 85-115
  - Backend validates octane range rather than enumerating all values
  - Most common octanes: 87 (regular), 89 (mid-grade), 91 (premium), 93 (super premium)
  - Required before setting fuel variants or prices for gasoline
