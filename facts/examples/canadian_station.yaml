key_differences_from_us:
  - "Single Pricing: No _cash or _credit suffixes"
  - "Currency: CAD instead of USD"
  - "Volume: Liters instead of gallons"
  - "Fact Keys: Use base fuel identifiers without payment method"
  - "Regional Logic: Determined by region.supportsCashCreditDistinction == false"

swift_implementation:
  regional_logic: |
    if region.supportsCashCreditDistinction {
        // US: Include payment method suffix
        factKey = "\(baseFuelKey)_\(paymentMethod.rawValue)"
    } else {
        // Canada: Use base fuel key without suffix
        factKey = baseFuelKey

notes: |
  - Same Swift code handles both US and Canadian stations automatically
  - Regional pricing logic determined by PriceRegion.supportsCashCreditDistinction
  - Uses specific fuel variant keys for ethanol content (octane_87_e10)
  - OpenStreetMap format for business hours works internationally
